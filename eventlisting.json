      "web_description": "<p>The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children&#8217;s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it&#8217;s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age (:55).&#160;</p>",

The books have simple stories and&#160;enchanting illustrations by Vincent that&#160;are characterized by graceful lines, muted colors and blurred edges, which focuses your attention on animals that, in their poignant delicacy, evoke Beatrix Potter. The screen character designs are broader and more overtly comic, but the three directors &#8212; Benjamin Renner, Vincent Patar and St&#233;phane Aubier &#8212; have retained enough of Vincent&#8217;s charming vision that the movie feels intimate and personal, as if it, too, had sprung from a single hand.</p>",

Not only was their architecture imaginative, so were the ideas behind it: that design could shape civic life; that art and architecture were inseparable; that while Europe and the United States were the cultural powers of the day, South America had a shot at tomorrow. The momentum broke down when a rash of right-wing military coups swept the continent. But the link between art and architecture remained firm and continues to. That&#8217;s the subject of this subtle, buoyant think-piece of a show of contemporary work, which extends to an open-air pavilion, designed by Terence Gower, set in the lush garden of the Andrew Freedman home across from the museum.</p>",

Specifically, it&#8217;s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965. Although visually and emotionally captivating, it leaves obscure details that a more conventional documentary would bring to light.</p>",

Gretchen Mol is excellent as his artist wife, and Josh Radnor (&#8220;How I Met Your Mother&#8221;), Karen Pittman and Danny Ashok give fine support (1:25).&#160;</p>",

Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread).</p>",

(She had founded the American Craft Council in 1939 and, before that, organized cooperatives of craftspeople up the Hudson in Putnam County during the Depression.) With her vision of a museum connected to various networks and marketplaces, Mrs. Webb affirmed craft &#8212; or &#8220;making,&#8221; or whatever you call it &#8212; as a deeply social activity and a source of economic self-empowerment.</p>",

It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d&#233;cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein&#8217;s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks.</p>",

During World War II, he fled south to Nice, only to have that city threatened with bombardment. Through everything, he worked on. It is this Matisse &#8212; the invalid, insomniac, night-worker and waking dreamer &#8212; we meet in the marvelous, victory-lap show that has arrived in New York from London, trailing light, praise and lines around the block.</p>",

When the opera is next presented, during the 2019-20 season, it will be in a staging by Stefan Herheim introduced at the Salzburg Festival in 2013. For this revival, the veteran bass-baritone James Morris, who turns 68 next month, saved the day by taking over the role of the shoemaker and master singer Hans Sachs when the scheduled singer&#160; withdrew. Mr. Morris&#8217;s voice may be a little worn and leathery these days, but he absolutely is the modest, wise and beloved Sachs, singing with authority and character. Other standouts are the superb tenor Johan Botha as the restless knight Walther and the fine soprano Annette Dasch as Eva, the young woman Walther falls for. James Levine is the conductor. (Michael Volle takes over the role of Sachs for the Dec. 13 performance, which is a Live in HD broadcast.)</p>",

In one of the graphite drawings from this marvelous gallery debut, Sylvester the Cat is involved in a nasty-looking pileup of cartoon body parts. Later comes a Popeye head sprouting from the beak of the Road Runner, surrounded by ducks who are floating skyward in the manner of Tiepolo figures.</p>",
